This is a simple script that reads from an environment file.

Create your own `environment.rb` file locally, and set the `ENV['user_name']` and `ENV['password']` variables to your desired values. Run the script with `ruby script.rb`.

Make sure not to commit your environment file to the repository, or you might expose your credentials!
